      Apollo NewsIssue #1October 2, 2024Sapporo Yuki Matsuri (Snow Festival) By MattUnfortunately, this year the snow festival in Sapporo was canceled because of COVID-19. Luckily, I went to the festival twice when I lived in Japan. The festival started in 1950 with six snow sculptures and now has hundreds of snow and ice sculptures. Some of the snow sculptures are so big that they are used as stages for performances.
