<h2> Flooding In Soma </h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}

On October 12th, Typhoon Hagibis (Typhoon 19) hit Japan. Flooding happened all over Soma. Both of the main rivers in Soma, Koizumi and Uta flooded. Around one quarter of the buildings in Soma flooded. Most of Soma lost water for one week. In the Soma area 21,000 people suffered from the water outage.  Only two weeks later there were heavy rains. The rains flooded more parts of the town. With the rains on the 25th and the typhoon on the 12th, a total of more than 3700 buildings were flooded. Now most of Soma is recovering but it will take a long time to be complete.

<h2>Review: Black Thunders (Candy Bars)</h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}
I'm an expert at candy bars. So today, I’m going to tell you about the best-tasting and worst-tasting black thunder bars.

**THE GOOD:** Here are the five best black thunder bars. (From good to bad)
1. **Black Thunder: Gold Cafe**			-　Rating: 5/5  
This is a coffee flavor black thunder, with chocolate chunks. I love coffee and I love this black thunder.
2. **Black Thunder: Dark Matter**			-　Rating: 5/5  
Dark Matter is a bigger black thunder and is full of dark chocolate.  When these were available I would buy them every time I went to the convenience store.
3. **Black Thunder: Next Gear**			-　Rating: 4.5/5  
Next Gear is full of almonds to give you some protein and energy. It’s similar to the Dark Matter. It’s on sale now at various convenience stores.

**THE BAD:** Here are the five worst tasting Black Thunder bars (from bad to good)
1. **“Roasted Corn” (とうもろこし) Thunder**	- 　Rating: 0/5  
You shouldn’t put corn in a Black Thunder. It’s gross. Even after you finish eating it, the taste will stay in your mouth. Disgusting.
2. **“Mochi-Mochi” Black Thunder: Azuki**	- 　Rating: 1/5  
I don’t really like Azuki, but it’s even worse when you mix it with chocolate. Even if you find this Black Thunder, don’t try it.
3. **Black Thunder: Hojicha Latte**			-　Rating: 1.5/5  
This one is available now, but it’s not worth 30 yen. If you want to have a special black thunder that’s available now, try the Morning Black Thunder (朝専用).
