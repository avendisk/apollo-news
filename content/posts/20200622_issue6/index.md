<h2> Protest </h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}
On May 25th 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man was killed by the police in Minneapolis, USA. In the USA, police are often violent especially to minorities.  After that people protested in the USA. The protests grew bigger and bigger. Soon people around the world were protesting. In America, some of the protests became violent. Police attacked the protesters and the protesters destroyed buildings.  In the past there have been similar protests. In 2014, Michael Brown,  a black 18-year-old was killed by the police in Ferguson, USA and there were protests all over the US. This time the protests are even bigger. Now, many things are happening in the USA. The coronavirus is spreading. The US has the most cases of coronavirus in the world. Because of this, many people are unemployed and many people saw the video of George Floyd’s death. They have also seen videos of the police attacking protesters. People see these videos and then they join the protests. Now, the protests continue and the police continue to arrest many protestors. Over 9,000 protesters have been arrested. Do you want to know more? You can read more on the website of the Associated Press.

<h2>Review: UFO Catcher Games</h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}
I hate UFO Catcher games. I think they are terrible. I don’t think they should even be called games. It should be called gambling. Or maybe a scam. Many of the games cost 100 yen per play and you need to play at least ten times to win. I don’t want to pay 1000 yen for a stuffed animal that is worth 200 yen. That’s crazy!
