<h2>UN Climate Action Summit</h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}
Greta Thunberg gave a speech at the UN Climate Action Summit on September 23rd. She told world leaders that she was angry, she said, “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”  Ms. Thunberg talked about climate change. She thinks that world leaders are not working to fix the problem.
   Ms. Thunberg is a 16 year old girl from Sweden who is worried about the future. She told the world leaders, “We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!”
   Ms Thunberg and many young people believe that the damage to the climate that these countries are doing is a violation of their human rights. Students all over the world students are going on strike on September 27th to protest government inaction.

<h2>Review: Hinomaru Sumo</h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}
There are so many high school sports animes. I usually don’t like them. A lot of sports anime are similar and they are often repetitive. I still watch them sometimes because they are easy to understand and it’s good Japanese practice.
Recently, I watched Hinomaru Sumo. The main character, Hinomaru Ushio, is a freshman in high school. He has dreams of becoming a professional sumo wrestler, even though he’s too short. 
Hinomaru Sumo is like other sports anime because all the characters have their own special skills. For example, Ozeki uses pushing and Yuma uses slapping. 
I like this anime because it's not as slow as other sports anime and I can learn a little bit about sumo.
