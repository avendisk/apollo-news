<h2> Pandemic </h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}
In December 2019, a virus started spreading in China. The virus, SARS-CoV-2, is often called COVID-19 or the coronavirus. By February, the virus spread all around the world. Many countries were not prepared for a pandemic and because of that many people caught the virus. Over 7 million people have caught the virus and over 4 hundred thousand people have died.   To stop the spread of COVID-19 many countries have taken precautions. For example, stopping traveling, working from home, canceling big events and social distancing. In some places things are going back to normal. In Japan, school is having class, restaurants are open and people are going back to work. It’s important to remember a few things to prevent another outbreak.

<ul>
    <li>Try to wash your hands often</li>
    <li>Wear a mask</li>
    <li>Don’t touch your eyes nose or mouth </li>
    <li>Cover your nose and mouth when you cough and sneeze</li>
    <li>Stay home if you feel sick</li>
    <li>If you have a fever and a cough, see a doctor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Review: Pandemic (Board Game)</h2>
{{< author name="Matt" >}}
Since I already talked about a real-life pandemic I want to talk about one that’s a lot more fun: Pandemic, the board game. This board game has all the players take on a disease. The goal of the game is to work together to eradicate the disease. You have to travel between cities, treat people, build research stations and discover a cure. It is one of the best cooperative board games. I think that in times like these, it’s important to remember that we can only fix the world’s problems if we work together.
